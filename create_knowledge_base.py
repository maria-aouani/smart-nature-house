- Physical breakage
- Pests

Solutions for Damaged Snake Plant:
- Let the soil dry completely before watering again
- Change to well-draining soil
- Reduce watering to every 2–3 weeks
- Keep plant in warm place
- Remove damaged parts using clean scissors
- Use neem oil weekly if pests or fungus appear
- Improve airflow around the plant

- Clean leaves regularly
- Avoid overcrowding plants
- Do not spray water on the leaves

4. What to Do If Snake Plant Is Dead:
- Remove the plant immediately
- Throw away the old soil (do not reuse)

- Water only when top of soil feels dry
- Fertilize once a month during growing season
- Make sure pot drains well

3. Fungal and Bacterial Problems:
a) Leaf Spot Disease:
- Brown/black spots with yellow edges
- Spots grow and join together

Solutions:
- Remove the affected leaves
- Avoid wetting the leaves
- Use copper fungicide
- Increase airflow

4. Pest Damage:

Common pests: Spider mites, aphids, mealybugs, scale

Symptoms:
- Tiny insects on leaves
- Sticky residue
- Fine webbing
-Yellow or spotty leaves

Solutions:
- Rinse plant with water
- Apply neem oil weekly
- Use insecticidal soap
- Keep the plant isolated
- Use natural helpers like ladybugs

3. Prevention Tips:
- Keep soil slightly moist, never flooded
- Avoid placing plant under strong sunlight
- Repot every 2–3 years
- Clean off dust from leaves
- Avoid using strong chemical fertilizers
- Keep greenhouse air flowing

4. What to Do If Spider Plant Is Dead:
- Remove entire plant from greenhouse
- Check if small baby plants can be saved
- Throw away soil and sterilize pot
- Look for cause: water, humidity, pests, light
- Adjust greenhouse conditions
